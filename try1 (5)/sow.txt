Make a page template for a generic site!

  HTML and CSS only

  It should not require any other files

  It shouldn't have too generic CSS rules

  Code style "as they do it"

  It should contain header, asides, section, footer

  Calm palette, simple font

  Header should contain logo, navigation, user panel

  Footer should contain contacts, links

  5 minutes is not enough. I needed at least 12. More like 15 even. My code style is ok. More empty lines maybe.
