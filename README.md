# [timed-coding](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/timed-coding)

Short coding sessions with minimal goal(s) and very limited timer. And when time is out, the project considered "finished" and "set in stone" (shouldn't be continued).

## Step sequence for sessions

  1. Decide on time limits for next three steps
  2. Write the statement of work
  3. Execute the task with highest possible concentration
  4. Review the results and the code
  5. Rest, relax
