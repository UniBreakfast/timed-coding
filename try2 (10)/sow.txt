Make a page template for a generic site!
  HTML and CSS only
  It should not require any other files
  It shouldn't have too generic CSS rules
  Code style "as they do it"
  It should contain header, asides, section, footer
  Calm palette, simple font
  Header should contain logo, navigation, user panel
  Footer should contain contacts, links
